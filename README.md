# Area measuring Tool

## General info
The area measuring tool is a web application run in the users browser. The user can open an image and measure an area. A requisite is that a reference length is entered. Then the user can trace the perimeter of the area in question with a polygon. The user is prevented from entering a complex polygon. The area is calculated using the Gauss shoelace formula.

## Technologies

The project is developed in TypeScript. The Canvas element is used to show image and graphical elements (such as polygons and rulers).
